# C Piscine
## About 42
The 42 Ecole selection process is an innovative approach to education in the field of technology, emphasizing a hands-on, collaborative learning environment. This unique selection method, taking place over approximately one month, involves a comprehensive evaluation of more than 400 candidates through projects, exams, and teamwork. During this period, participants have the opportunity to enhance a wide range of skills, including C programming, algorithms, shell scripting, group collaboration, time management, and self-learning, among others. This rigorous process culminates in the "C Piscine," a 26-day intensive bootcamp that focuses on C programming and serves as the final hurdle before becoming a "cadet" at 42. This model, devoid of traditional classrooms and teachers, leverages peer-to-peer learning, fostering not only technical abilities but also essential life skills. Admission to the 42 program is free for those who successfully navigate through its selection process, offering an unprecedented educational experience that prepares students for the challenges of the technology sector.

## Skills developed at C Piscine

### Hard-skills
	# C Language
		The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
		pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
		including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

	# Shell
		The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
		shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

	# Git
		All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
		be at ease with such a system.

### Soft-skills
	# Self-learning and proactiveness
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

	# Teamwork
		On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly
		chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
		The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a
		common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

	# Time management and resiliency
		The school is open 24/7. Thus, the so-called "pisciners" are free to work whenever
		they want, which demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not
		"drowning" amid the massive load of work demanded by the non-stop 26-day program.
